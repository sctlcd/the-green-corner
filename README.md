## About <a name="About"></a>

The general purpose of this website is TO_ADD. And this anytime, anywhere as this game is available on various devices as desktops, tablets and mobile.

**The Green Corner** is

### How to use it? <a name="HowToUseIt"></a>

TO_ADD

### Why this project? <a name="WhyThisProject"></a>

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **Data Centric Development** module. The objective of this milestone project is building a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

For this project we could choose from one of the following ideas:
- Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.
- Create an online cookbook
- Create a jargon glossary/dictionary for a particular domain
- Build a book review and recommendation site

I've decided to create a modern responsive Web tool for gathering plant specifications and identifying flora worldwide using HTML, CSS, Materialize CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, FLask and Python and MongoDB.

## UX  <a name="UX"></a>

### User Stories <a name="UserStories"></a>

"***As a user, I want to _____***"

- [x] View the site from **any devices** (mobile, tablet, desktop).

<br>
- [x] *marked the item as implemented successfully*

### Design <a name="Design"></a>

When it comes about digital TO_ADD
This is why I have designed my entire project around TO_ADD.

I choose logo/ pictures/ color palette/ not too many colors for making the page more readable, less saturated as the images bring already a lot of colors TO_ADD.    

I picked the palette by using the color scheme generator from a photo of the website logo, named [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/image-picker).

I choose a Google Font [](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/) which TO_ADD.


#### Framework <a name="Framework"></a>

- [Materialize CS 0.100.2](https://materializecss.com/) - Responsive front-end framework based on Material Design
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) - Lightweight (micro) framework for building web applications

#### Color Scheme <a name="ColorScheme"></a>

In keeping with the **TO_ADD**  idea, I have chosen a color scheme quite sober referring to the elements of nature. I first choose my [logo](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/planet-earth_1598196?term=plant&page=1&position=41) from Flaticon(https://www.flaticon.com). From there, I used the color scheme generator [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/image-picker) which generated the following [palette](https://coolors.co/98cae9-1c5925-31628b-3caf4e-000000) from my logo picture. And Finally I selected picture which fit well in my color scheme and in the space allocated.

- ![#98CAE9](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#98CAE9`- Light Cornflower Blue
- ![#1c5925](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#1c5925`- Lincoln Green
- ![#31628b](https://placehold.it/15/98CAE9/98CAE9) `#31628b`- Lapis Lazuli
- ![#3caf4e](https://placehold.it/15/3caf4e/3caf4e) `#3caf4e`- Green Pantone
- ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/3caf4e/3caf4e) `#000000`- Black
- ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/fafafa) `#fafafa`

#### Icons <a name="Icons"></a>

- [Font Awesome 5.14.0](https://fontawesome.com/)
 - It fits my needs for this project.
- [Material Design 0.100.2](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)
  - It fits my needs for this project.

#### Typography <a name="Typography"></a>

- I have opted to use the Google Font TO_ADD

### Wireframes <a name="Wireframes"></a>

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) for my wireframes because:
- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence until end of 2020. I got to use this software a few year ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance to use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing on structure and content.

My wireframes for this project can be found [here](TO_ADD) in the wireframes sub-directory.

### Compatibility <a name="Compatibility"></a>

I tested the website across the 6 main browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration to ensure a large number of users can use it successfully.

- Chrome v.81.0
- Edge v.44
- Firefox v.75.0
- Safari v.5.1.7 for Windows 10
- Opera v.68.0
- Internet Explorer v.11

|All pages | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Opera | IE |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expected appearance |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Expected responsiveness |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- IE: Some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported

- Safari v.5.1.7: It’s an outdated version and lacks many of the features present in the latest version of Safari. The last version of Safari for Windows was released on May 9, 2012.

### Testing left <a name="Testingleft"></a>

- There is no way to install the latest version of the Safari browser on Windows 10 as Apple stopped developing Safari for Windows operating system long ago.
For testing this website on the latest version of Safari, I will have to install the newest version of macOS on Windows 10 in a virtual machine.
